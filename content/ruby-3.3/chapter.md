# Upgrading Ruby to 3.3

There is another quick win we have available to us. Ruby 3.3 was released in December 2023, and it has a number of performance improvements over Ruby 3.2. Let's upgrade our Ruby version to 3.3 and see how it affects our performance.

Upgrading is as simple as updating the value in the `.ruby-version` file in the root of our project. If you don't yet have Ruby 3.3.1 installed on your machine, you can install it with whatever mechanism you use to manage Ruby versions (e.g. `rbenv install 3.3.1` or `asdf install ruby 3.3.1`). Once you have Ruby 3.3.1 installed, run `bundle install` to download the necessary gems for the new Ruby version.

Once ready, restart your Rails server process in your first terminal window, and then run the `posts_index` and `posts_create` load tests in your second terminal window.

When I ran

```sh
oha -c 20 -z 10s -m POST http://localhost:3000/benchmarking/posts_index
```

I got these results:

Compared to the previous results, the slowest response time dropped from 0.3261 seconds to 0.5737 seconds (43% worse), the fastest response time dropped from 0.0062 seconds to 0.0044 seconds (29% better), the average response time increased from 0.0867 seconds to 0.0475 seconds (45% better), and the requests per second increased from 231.1223 to 421.4724 (82% better). All in all, a solid improvement.

Then, when I ran

```sh
oha -c 20 -z 10s -m POST http://localhost:3000/benchmarking/post_create

I got these results:

We see similar improvements for the write operation. The slowest response time dropped from 0.2113 seconds to 0.2302 seconds (9% worse), the fastest response time dropped from 0.0040 seconds to 0.0028 seconds (30% better), the average response time increased from 0.0320 seconds to 0.0238 seconds (34% better), and the requests per second increased from 624.2716 to 839.2937 (35% better).

Without any complicated code changes or mind-cracking debugging, we were able to completely eliminate all of our `500` error responses, notably improve our throughput for read operation (from ~40 RPS to ~400), and massively improve our p99.99 latency (from ~5 seconds to ~50 milliseconds). All of this by installing one gem and bumping to the latest Ruby version. I love quick wins!
