# Running Baseline Load Tests

Before we start, let's establish a baseline. This is the starting point from which we will measure our progress. It's important to have a clear understanding of where we are now, so we can see how far we've come.

We will run two load tests to assess the current state of the application's performance; one for the `post_create` action and one for the `posts_index` action. We will run each test with 20 concurrent requests for 10 seconds.

We will run the read operation first since it can't have any effect on the write operation performance (while the inverse cannot be said). But first, it is often worth checking that the endpoint is responding as expected _before_ running a load test. So, let's make a single `curl` request first.

In one terminal window, start the Rails server:

```sh
RELAX_SSL=true RAILS_LOG_LEVEL=warn RAILS_ENV=production WEB_CONCURRENCY=10 RAILS_MAX_THREADS=5 bin/rails server
```

In another, make a single `curl` request to the `posts_index` endpoint:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/benchmarking/posts_index
```

You should see an HTML response with a footer near the bottom of the page:

```
<footer class="mt-auto text-sm text-center">
  <p class="py-4">
    Made with &heartsuit; by <a href="https://twitter.com/fractaledmind" class="underline focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-500">@fractaledmind</a> for <a href="https://railsconf.org" class="underline focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-500">RailsConf 2024</a>
  </p>
</footer>
```

If you see that response, everything is working as expected. If you don't, you may need to troubleshoot the issue before proceeding.

Once we have verified that our Rails application is responding to the `benchmarking/posts_index` route as expected, we can run the load test and record the results.

As stated earlier, we will use the `oha` tool to run the load test. We will send waves of 20 concurrent requests, which is twice the number of Puma workers that our application has spun up. We will run the test for 10 seconds. The command to run the load test is as follows:

```sh
oha -c 20 -z 10s -m POST http://localhost:3000/benchmarking/posts_index
```

Running this on my 2021 M1 MacBook Pro (32 GB of RAM running MacOS 12.5.1), I get the following results:

A quick analysis of the results shows that the average response time is 108 ms, with the slowest response taking **over 5 seconds**! This means that the slowest request is _~50× slower_ than the average. Then, even on my high-powered laptop over localhost, our server can only support ~40 requests per second; this is a low number, and should be higher. Plus, we see 7 responses returning a 500 status code, which is not what we want.

Now that we have the baseline for the `posts_index` action, we can move on to the `post_create` action. We will follow the same steps as above, but this time we will run the load test on the `post_create` endpoint.

With the Rails server still running in one terminal window, we can make a single `curl` request to the `post_create` endpoint in another:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/benchmarking/post_create
```

Again, you should see the `<footer>` in the response. If you don't, you may need to troubleshoot the issue before proceeding.

Once we have verified that our Rails application is responding to the `benchmarking/post_create` route as expected, we can run the load test and record the results.

```sh
oha -c 20 -z 10s -m POST http://localhost:3000/benchmarking/post_create
```

Immediately, it should jump out just how many `500` responses we are seeing. **77%** of the responses are returning an error status code. Suffice it to say, this is not at all what we want from our application. We still see some requests taking over 5 seconds to complete, which is aweful. But at least for a single resource write request we are seeing a healthier ~380 requests per second.

Our first challenge is to fix these performance issues.
